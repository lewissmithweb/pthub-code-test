# Backend code test - Lewis Smith

Tests can be run using 

```
vendor/bin/phpunit tests
```

I've not specifically read the PSR12 standards and in the past I have used linters to achieve
a standard as part of a pipeline, so there might be the odd error that doesn't match 
the standard

However this is something easily learned and should I progress I'll be sure to look into
the standard docs and remind myself of them. I think I meet most of them already.
